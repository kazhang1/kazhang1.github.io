  <li>This is a summation tracker of the maximum resource rewards from each and every special event thus far in Dragalia Lost.</li>
  <li>There are slightly different definitions of "maximum" for each type of event.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>For every type of event the rewards for story views, first clears, stage endeavors, event endeavors, and event daily endeavors are included.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>For raid events, this accounts for all of the rewards for reaching all the emblem milestones.</li>
  <li>For facility events, this accounts for all of the prestige milestones as well as all of the resources in the event currency shop.</li>
  <li>For story events, this accounts for all of the resources in the event currency shop.</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>This is simply a running tally I decided to start up early in the game just to see how rewards from events have changed, events in DL aren't exactly the type you need a calculator or anything for</li>
  <li>For the time being I have excluded exclusive event rewards, here is a link to the event archive at gamepedia that has info on exclusive rewards: <a href="https://dragalialost.gamepedia.com/Events/Archive" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>https://dragalialost.gamepedia.com/Events/Archive</span></a></li>
  <li>Event banner images are pulled directly from either the game itself or the Dragalia Lost english website at 
    <a href="https://dragalialost.com/en/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>https://dragalialost.com/en/</span></a></li>
  <li>You can download the raw data as a csv with <a href="eventData.csv" download><span>here</span><a></li>
  <li>There's a suggestion box below (currently nonfunctional) for people to send me suggestions or feedback.</li>
